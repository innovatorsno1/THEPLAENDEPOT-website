  	Fuselage: The main body of the aircraft, where passengers and cargo are typically located. It houses the cockpit, cabin, and cargo holds.
	Wings: These are the structures attached to the fuselage that generate lift, allowing the plane to fly. They also often contain fuel tanks.
	Empennage: This includes the tail section of the aircraft, consisting of the horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer (or fin), elevators, and rudder. These control surfaces help stabilize and steer the plane.
	Engines: These provide the thrust necessary to move the aircraft forward. Depending on the type of aircraft, engines can be mounted on the wings (most common), the fuselage, or even embedded within the tail.
	Landing Gear: This includes the wheels and associated mechanisms that allow the aircraft to take off, land, and taxi on the ground. It typically consists of main landing gear attached to the fuselage or wings and a nose landing gear under the cockpit.
	Avionics: This refers to the electronic systems used for navigation, communication, and flight control. It includes instruments and systems such as radios, transponders, autopilot, and navigation displays.
		Control Surfaces: These are movable surfaces on the wings and tail that control the aircraft's attitude and direction. They include ailerons (on the wings for roll control), elevators (on the tail for pitch control), and the rudder (also on the tail for yaw control).

 The first plane ever invented was the Wright Flyer.<br/>
   The Wright Flyer was built on December 17, 1903.<br/>
   The made by the Wright Brothers name Orville and Wilbur Wright, they have achieved this historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, USA which went four flights that day, with Orville piloting the first and longest one, covering a distance of 120 feet (about 36.5 meters) in 12 seconds <br/>
   This is the photo of the Wright Flyer:
